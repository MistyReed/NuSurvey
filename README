UC Davis Department of Nutrition has a grant that they have been researching and developing surveys to aid parents and children evaluate habits to help determine goals to a healthier life.  Surveys are currently filled out on paper and hand scored, from the scores a goal sheet is created and handed out to participants.  A computerized survey system is needed to help aid in scoring and eventually allow anyone to fill out a survey online.

The scope of this project is to deliver an application that will allow for entering results of a group of surveys and automatically calculate results and generate goal sheets.  For the current phase, this application will be restricted to specific users and will only provide a method for entering surveys from an administrative view.  Future phases will involve interfaces to allow anyone to fill out the surveys and other customizing features.
